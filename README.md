## Setup

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use your preferred Git client to clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Node.js**: This project requires Node.js. If you don't have Node.js version 21 installed, you can download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

3. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Application**: Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Start the Server**: In a separate terminal window, start the server by running:

   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

6. **Run Both at The Same Time**: If you want to start both the application and the server at the same time, you can run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev:all
   ```

After running these commands, your default web browser should automatically open and navigate to `localhost:5173`, where you can see the running application. The server will be running on `localhost:8080`.
